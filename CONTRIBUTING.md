## Build Instructions

To package the extension into a `.vsix` file yourself:
1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.
2. Run `npx vsce package`.
3. This will create the `.vsix` file in the current directory.

## Development
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build once: `npm run compile` (or `npm run watch` during development).
3. Press `F5` in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host.
